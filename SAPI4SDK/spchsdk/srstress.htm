<h1><font face="Arial">Speech Recognition Stress Tester</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">SRStress.exe is a stress test for speech recognition engines. Its
purpose is to look for memory leaks and crashes that might occur under stressful
situations, such as long usage, multiple instances, and low resources. It does not
indicate if an engine complies with the Speech API.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Application developers that intend to bundle or recommend an engine,
may wish to use the stress test to insure the stability of the engine. Stability is
particulary important for telephony applications.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To use the stress test:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Click Run It!</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Read the instructions and press Next.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Select the speech engines you wish to test.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Choose a difficulty level.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Press Next.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Type in a directory containing grammars files. You can use the
    grammar files provided in the SDK, or make your own. Ideally, you should provide grammar
    files that are the same or similar to what your application will use.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Record an input .WAV file using the Wave Editor provided in the SDK,
    or with some other wave editor. The input file should be at least a couple minutes long,
    and include speech. Exactly what's said doesn't matter because this is not an accuracy
    test, and virtually any recording of speech should be enough to stress the engine. You
    should leave some silence in the audio though.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">You can have one of the test instances use audio from the PC
    microphone instead of the wave file. This may provide more variety to the audio,
    especially if you turn your radio or TV on. Only one instance of the engine will use PC
    microphone; all the others will use the wave files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Type in the number of threads/instances you wish to test. If you
    application only uses one instance of an engine at a time then you can leave the value as
    1. However, if your engine uses several instances, then set the number higher, such as 4
    or 8.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Press Next.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The stress test will run. Leave it running until the engine crashes.
    You can use several iterations to determine a mean-time-to-failure, and evaluate if the
    mean-time-to-failure is acceptable. The stress test exercises the engine much more
    strenuously than a typical application would.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">If the engine doesn't crash after several days of testing then you
    can stop the test.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The stress test will write log files out under c:\srstressX.txt,
    where X is the thread number.</font></li>
</ul>
