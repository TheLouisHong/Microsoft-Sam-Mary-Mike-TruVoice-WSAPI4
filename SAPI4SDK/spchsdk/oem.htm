<h1><font face="Arial">For OEMs (PC, sound card, and voice modem manufactuers)</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">Many sound cards and sound devices shipped today do not work well
with Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech because of a few small flaws in their design.
Luckily, the flaws are easy to fix and significantly improve the usability of speech for
the user. This document describes the work that an OEM should do to insure the speech
recognition and text-to-speech work well on their sound device.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note: This document references the Telex desktop microphone and
Telex Nomad microphone as a means of testing the sound device. The intent is NOT to
promote any particular microphone. Telex microphones are mentioned because they are widely
available.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">CPU Wave-in/out Functionality</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">This section describes the functionality that a sound device and
microphone should have to produce good speech recognition and text-to-speech from the
PC&#146;s local microphone and speaker.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Wave Out</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">For text-to-speech to work well on a sound card, the sound
card&#146;s DAC should support:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">16-bit, mono. 8 kHz, 11.25 kHz, 16.00 kHz, and 22.50 kHz sampling
    rates need to be supported by the DAC.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Volume control for the digital output also needs to be supported.
    Volume should be on a linear scale from 0x0000 to 0xffff. Since most mixer chips support
    decibels, the driver needs to convert between linear and logarithmic. 0xffff is -0.0 dB.
    0x8000 is -6.0 dB. 0x4000 is -12.0 dB. Etc. Every halving of the volume is 6 dB less.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">waveOutGetPos() needs to be accurate to within 1/60th second so that
    lip synchronization code works well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The DMA ping-pong buffers should be less than or equal to 1/16th of a
    second apiece to insure fast response times for starting and stopping playback.</font></li>
</ul>

<h3><font face="Arial">Wave In</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">For speech recognition to work well, the wave in driver should
support:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">16-bit mono. 8 kHz, 11.25 kHz, 16.00 kHz, and 22.50 kHz.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Volume control for the digital record also needs to be supported.
    Volume should be on a linear scale from 0x0000 to 0xffff. Since most mixer chips support
    decibels, the driver needs to convert between linear and logarithmic. 0xffff is -0.0 dB.
    0x8000 is -6.0 dB. 0x4000 is -12.0 dB. Etc. Every halving of the volume is 6 dB less.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The attenuation should range from at least 0.0 dB to -24 dB. A range
    of 40 dB is desirable to accommodate more microphones.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The DMA ping-pong buffers should be less than or equal to 1/16th of a
    second apiece to insure fast response times for starting and stopping record. Smaller DMA
    buffers also improve speech recognition response time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Enough gain so that when Telex Nomad is worn (or telex desktop is
    spoken to from 6&quot; to 12&quot; distance) and attenuation is -12 dB from max,
    user&#146;s normal speech will peek VU at about -6DB from max. See below for information
    that we supply about the test application.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The combination of the ambient noise from the microphone and sound
    card should not be louder than -33 dB. It should be closer to -45 dB for dictation to work
    well. See below for information about the test application.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">If the user speaks too loudly and clipping occurs, make sure that the
    signal as distorted as little as possible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Watch out for 60 Hz hum.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Hardware automatic gain decreases speech recognition accuracy.
    It&#146;s best to let the speech recognizer control the volume.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">(Optional) The Microsoft Multimedia DDK describes a &quot;low
    priority&quot; wave-in driver which allows speech recognition to listen all of the time.
    If another application plays a sound or records, the speech recognition &quot;device&quot;
    is preempted while the other sound is playing/recording. When the other sound finishes,
    speech recognition regains control. If a sound device does not support low priority then
    no sounds can be played while speech recognition is listening. If low priority is
    supported, then modifications need to be made to the mixer. Make sure that low priority is
    thoroughly tested; many implementations that we've seen have been buggy.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">(Optional) The wave-in and wave-out should be &quot;full duplex&quot;
    so it&#146;s possible to record and play at the same time. However, most CODECs only
    handle full duplex of the same sampling rates. An ideal solution would be to allow
    recording at one sampling rate, and playback at another sampling rate.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">(Optional) If the system is full duplex, it would be beneficial for
    echo-canceling chipsets to automatically eliminate the PC&#146;s output waveform from the
    microphone. This ensures that the PC doesn&#146;t listen to itself. The echo canceling
    should not only remove wave-out, but also MIDI and CD audio signals so that a user can
    speak to his computer while MIDI or CD music is playing.</font></li>
</ul>

<h3><font face="Arial">Mixer</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The sound card/device driver needs to support the mixer
architecture, described in the Windows DDK. The mixer should have:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Volume should be on a linear scale from 0x0000 to 0xffff. Since most
    mixer chips support decibels, the driver needs to convert between linear and logarithmic.
    0xffff is -0.0 dB. 0x8000 is -6.0 dB. 0x4000 is -12.0 dB. Etc. Every halving of the volume
    is 6 dB less.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Playback Line</font><p><font face="Arial">Master volume control - Set
    to a reasonable level by default. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Wave-out volume - Set to a reasonable level by default. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Mute ability </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">(Optional) - Mixer control so the user can hear what the microphone
    hears. This can only be turned on if the user has headphones, otherwise a feedback loop
    will be produced. This should be off by default just in case the user plugs in speakers. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Recording Line</font><p><font face="Arial">Microphone volume - Set to
    0x4000 (-12 dB) by default. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Line-in volume - Some users will plug an amplified microphone signal
    into their line-in. Set to 0x4000 (-12 dB) by default. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Mixer control or multiplexer control to select between microphone
    and line-in. Set to the microphone by default. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">If the volume is 0 then mute the incoming audio. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">In general, when the user plugs in the microphone all defaults should
    be set so &quot;it just works&quot;. See below for the test application.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">(Optional) If the wave-in device supports &quot;low priority&quot;
    (see the Microsoft DDK) then it also needs to support a &quot;Voice Commands&quot; mixer
    line with the same functionality as the &quot;Recording Line&quot;.</font></li>
</ul>

<h3><font face="Arial">Microphone</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The minimum microphone required is one that:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">One that rests on the desktop, sits on top of the monitor, is built
    into the monitor, or clips on to the user&#146;s shirt. Microphones built into the
    keyboard have problems because they pick up keyboard clicks. Microphones should be
    designed so that users place them no more than 18&quot; from their mouth; The closer the
    better. The best microphones are: close-talk, ear-piece, or handset.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Basically the same frequency response as the Telex desktop or Nomad.
    Having a significantly different frequency response will result in lower out-of-the-box
    accuracy since most engine vendors have built their speaker-independent recognition models
    based upon the Telex microphone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Directional (carteoid or hyper-carteoid). Omni-directional
    microphones pick up too much fan noise from the air-conditioning and CPU fan.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">(Optional) Close-talk microphone. A close-talk microphone is worn on
    the user&#146;s head and provides much better speech recognition accuracy than a desktop
    because the microphone element is close to the user&#146;s mouth. When bundling a
    close-talk microphone, look for:</font><p><font face="Arial">Near-field so it works better
    in noisy environments. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The microphone should be comfortable enough to wear for long periods
    of time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">It should be easy to put on and take off. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Make sure it doesn&#146;t flop/move around when user moves his/her
    head. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The cord should be long enough so the user can lean back in his/her
    chair. </font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><font face="Arial">CPU Housing</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The design of the CPU housing should have:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users should be able to plug in Telex Nomad or Telex desktop
    directly, without the need for adapters and amplifiers. Some sound cards require adapters
    right now, causing the users unnecessary confusion.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Clearly label holes that microphone and headphones are plugged into.
    The jacks might even be in the front of the CPU so they&#146;re easily accessed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Use good connectors. Bad ones cause noise/static when move microphone
    is tugged slightly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">(Optional) Ultra-quiet fans reduce the ambient noise in the room and
    improve accuracy.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">(Optional) The CPU or monitor should come with built-in sound so the
    user doesn&#146;t have to do extra work to plug in speakers.</font></li>
</ul>

<h2><font face="Arial">VU Test Application</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The VU test application displays a VU meter and shows the latest
peak signal level in dB. To run the test application click here.</font>

<ul>
  <li><a href="misc\vu.exe"><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Run it!</strong></font></a></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">If a wave-in device is working well, the test application will
produce the following results on a clean (new install of the sound driver) machine. These
tests assume that a Telex Nomad microphone is worn, or that a Telex desktop microphone is
about 12&quot; away from the speaker&#146;s mouth. The speaker is talking at a comfortable
volume:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">First of all, the VU meter applet must start up, and it&#146;s VU
    must show that it hears the user.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The volume control slider must appear. If not the speech recognition
    cannot control the volume source. Move it up or down controls the volume of the
    microphone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">When the user is quiet, the peak level will be no more than -33 dB.
    For dictation to work well it needs to be around -45 dB. (The volume is assumed to be set
    to 0x4000).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">When the user speaks, the peak level is between -9 dB and -3 dB. It
    should not clip. (The volume is assumed to be set to 0x4000.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">(Optional) A tester can bring up Sound Recorder (or some other
    application) and play a digital audio sound while the VU meter is running. In a
    low-priority system the VU audio will temporarily pause while the sound is being played.
    In a full-duplex system recording will continue uninterrupted while the sound is played.</font></li>
</ul>

<h2><font face="Arial">Voice-Modem Wave-in/out Functionality</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">This section describes the functionality that a voice-modem sound
device should have to produce good speech recognition and text-to-speech.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">TAPI</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Voice Modem should support TAPI and allow the application to
acquire the wave in/out device through TAPI.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Wave Out</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">For text-to-speech to work well on a voice model, the voice
modem&#146;s DAC should support:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">16-bit, mono, 8 kHz (PCM) sampling rates need to be supported by the
    DAC.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Volume control for the digital output also needs to be supported.
    Volume should be on a linear scale from 0x0000 to 0xffff. Since most mixer chips support
    decibels, the driver needs to convert between linear and logarithmic. 0xffff is -0.0 dB.
    0x8000 is -6.0 dB. 0x4000 is -12.0 dB. Etc. Every halving of the volume is 6 dB less.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Response time for opening, pausing, resuming, and closing the
    wave-out device should be very quick. Voice modems that use a serial connection do not
    provide fast enough response time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Overhead for playing PCM data should be low. Voice modems that send
    compressed digital audio over the serial connection are too slow.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The DMA ping-pong buffers should be less than or equal to 1/16th of a
    second apiece to insure fast response times for starting and stopping playback.</font></li>
</ul>

<h3><font face="Arial">Wave In</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">For speech recognition to work well, the voice modem&#146;s wave in
driver should support:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">16-bit, mono, 8 kHz (PCM) sampling rates need to be supported by the
    ADC.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Volume control for the digital record also needs to be supported.
    Volume should be on a linear scale from 0x0000 to 0xffff. Since most mixer chips support
    decibels, the driver needs to convert between linear and logarithmic. 0xffff is -0.0 dB.
    0x8000 is -6.0 dB. 0x4000 is -12.0 dB. Etc. Every halving of the volume is 6 dB less.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Response time for opening and closing the wave-in device should be
    very quick. Voice modems that use a serial connection do not provide fast enough response
    time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Overhead for recording PCM data should be low. Voice modems that send
    compressed digital audio over the serial connection are too slow.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The DMA ping-pong buffers should be less than or equal to 1/16th of a

    buffers also improve speech recognition response time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">If the user speaks too loudly and clipping occurs, make sure that the
    signal as distorted as little as possible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Watch out for 60 Hz hum.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">(Optional) The wave-in and wave-out should be &quot;full duplex&quot;
    so it&#146;s possible to record and play at the same time. If the system is full duplex,
    it&#146;s necessary for echo-canceling chipsets to automatically eliminate the output
    waveform from the input waveform. This ensures that the speech recognition doesn&#146;t
    listen to audio being played out. The full duplex and echo-canceling feature allows the
    user to interrupt the computer while the computer is speaking a prompt.</font></li>
