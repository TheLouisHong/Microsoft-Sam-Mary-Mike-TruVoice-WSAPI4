<h1><font face="Arial">A clock you can talk to</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The Speech Recognition Clock Demo (SRCLK in the samples\clock
directory) demonstrates the use of the Speech Recognition and Text-To-Speech Application
interface. Upon recognition of certain voice commands, SRCLK responds audibly with the
current time or date using text-to-speech. SRCLK was built using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To use SRCLK, run the application and ask &quot;What is the
date?&quot; or &quot;What time is it?&quot; SRCLK will respond with the correct date or
time. You can also ask for the time in other cities such as London, Stockholm, or Tokyo.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Low-Priority Mode Drivers</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The Speech Recognition Clock demo uses both speech recognition (SR)
AND text-to-speech (TTS). If the wave input driver being used does not support
low-priority mode, there are certain functions which must be performed before
text-to-speech will work properly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Here's why: When the wave input device is opened in low priority
mode by a process (for example, speech recognition), that device is available to any
process that subsequently requests it (for example, wave output for text-to-speech). When
the requesting process relinquishes the device, it is again available to the original
process. In a driver that doesn't support-low-priority mode, the original process (e.g.,
speech recognition) gains exclusive use of the wave-in device and does not relinquish it
until it is finished. Therefore, the requesting process (text-to-speech) cannot open the
device.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">SRCLK employs a workaround for handling drivers that don't support
low-priority mode. It deactivates speech recognition when text-to-speech requires the
device and reactivate speech recognition when text-to-speech is done.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Notes</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">SRCLK reads a data file (srclk.dat) which contains time zone
information for various cities worldwide. You can modify this data file to add or delete
cities. The syntax is simply the city name followed by a corresponding time zone bias
separated by a comma. The time zone bias value is the number of hours the city is away
from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">For example, London is the same time zone as GMT so its bias value
is 0. Seattle is Pacific time which is eight hours behind GMT so its bias value is -8,
etc.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">SRCLK contains 6 source modules:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">init.cpp - Windows initialization code</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">showdib.cpp - Loads and displays clock bitmap</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">vcmd.cpp - Contains code for interacting with the SR and TTS
    interfaces</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">srclk.cpp - Main procedure and miscellaneous functions for the clock</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">clkhands.cpp - Contains code for initializing and drawing the clock
    hands.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">srclkdlg.cpp - Contains code for handling the Clock Options and About
    dialogs</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Miscellaneous required files:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">srclk.dat - Text file containing the city and time zone information
    file</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">srclk.bmp - Bitmap file containing the clock's graphical face</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">SRCLK builds a VCMD list for the cities it will recognize. If
Microsoft Voice is running the user can find out what the names of these cities are by
saying &quot;What can I say&quot; and clicking on &lt;CITYNAME&gt;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>You need this to run:</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Command &amp; Control Speech Recognition Engine</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Text-to-speech engine</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>A navigator application must be running</strong>. You can
    install <strong>Microsoft Voice</strong>, or just run <a href="feedback.htm">Feedback</a>.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>You can:</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><a href="sr\command\srclock.exe"><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Run it!</strong></font></a><font
    size="3" face="Arial"> (For this demo to work, you <strong>must</strong> have Microsoft
    Voice (or a similar application) running and turn speech recognition on using it.)</font></li>

    size="3" face="Arial"> (SRCLK.Exe requires that a file, srclk.dat, be in the same
    directory. Unless you copy the file to your WinDebug/WinRel directories, you will not be
    able to run the SRCLK.Exe that you build.)</font></li>
