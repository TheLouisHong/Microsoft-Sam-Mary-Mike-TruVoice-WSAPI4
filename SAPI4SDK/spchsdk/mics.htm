<h1><font face="Arial">Microphone Usability</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">Microphones are necessary for speech recognition to function, and
the quality/ergonomics of a microphone can make the different between an unusable speech
product, and one where speech recognition shines. A good microphone will have half the
speech-recognition error rate of a poor microphone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">However, microphones are one of the largest impediments to people
using speech recognition. In general, the failure points are:</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users don't have a microphone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users don't have the microphone plugged into the computer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The sound card isn't compatible with the microphone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">If the microphone gain is so high that clipping happens then accuracy
    will be terrible. If it's too low then accuracy won't be as good as possible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users don't know how to hold/position a microphone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Cheap (poor quality) microphones are the norm. (Luckily, this is
    starting to change.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The most accurate microphones require that the users wears them. Many
    users don't like wearing microphones.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial">If a speech aware application doesn't take all of these factors into
account, many users will be unable to get speech recognition to function well. To avoid
microphone problems, we recommend that your application use the <a href="micwiz.htm">Microphone
Setup Wizard</a> (programmatically available from the Speech Tools API).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Usability of specific types of microphones</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">If you are considering bundling a microphone with your application,
sound card, or PC, here is some usability information on specific types of microphones.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Close-talk</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Acceptable close-talk microphones now sell for about $50 (US) at
    computer stores, and are worth the expense if users wan't maximum accuracy.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Highest accuracy of any type of microphone because the element is
    close to the mouth, and almost always near-field.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Near-field element so it's noise resistant.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User has his/her hands free.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User can lean back in his/her chair and talk. (Make sure the
    microphone cord is long enough so users can lean back, even if their PC is under their
    desk.)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Most users dislike wearing something or being attached to their PC.
    Sometimes the cord gets tugged on when the user moves around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">It's difficult to talk on the phone with a telephone handset while
    wearing the close-talk, unless the phone is routed through the headset. Some headsets have
    this functionality.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Slow to put on and take off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The user has to reposition the element every time they put the
    microphone on. When the element position changes so does the sound of the audio. Users
    must be aware of this so they don't make this mistake.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Sometimes users position the element directly in front of their
    mouth, causing recognition problems when they exhale onto the element. Users must be aware
    of this so they don't make this mistake.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Ear Piece</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Second only to close-talk and handset microphones in accuracy because
    the element is close to the mouth.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Some ear-piece microphones have a near-field element so it's noise
    resistant.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User has his/her hands free.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User can lean back in his/her chair and talk. (Make sure the
    microphone cord is long enough so users can lean back, even if their PC is under their
    desk.)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Most users dislike wearing something or being attached to their PC.
    Sometimes the cord gets tugged on when the user moves around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Difficult to talk on the phone with a telephone handset while wearing
    the close-talk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Slow to put on and take off.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Handset</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Second only to close-talk and ear-piece microphones in accuracy
    because the element is close to the mouth.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Some handset microphones have a near-field element so it's noise
    resistant.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users don't like talking to computers, and don't like it when
    colleagues walk by their office and see the user &quot;talking to themselves.&quot; With a
    handset, users feel like they're talking to a person (or at least an answering machine),
    and people walking by just see someone talking on the phone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Some handsets have switches that allow the user to turn speech
    recognition on/off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Of all the microphones, users are already trained to use this one.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Easy to pick up and put down.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User can lean back in his/her chair and talk. (Make sure the
    microphone cord is long enough so users can lean back, even if their PC is under their
    desk.)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users have to hold the handset, which can get tiring if it's used for
    long periods of time.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Clip-On</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Moderate accuracy because it's less than 30 cm from the mouth.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User's hands freed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The microphone element is out of the way.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User can lean back in his/her chair and talk.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Most users dislike wearing something or being attached to their PC.
    Sometimes the cord gets tugged on when the user moves around.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Slow to put on and take off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users don't know exactly where to clip the microphone on.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Not good in a noisy environment.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Desktop</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Moderate accuracy if it's positioned less than 30 cm from the mouth.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User's hands are freed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Cheap.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">The user has a &quot;stick&quot; pointing towards him, and usually
    doesn't like this since it's visually distracting. Most users will reposition the
    microphone so it points upwards, which reduces accuracy.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users don't always know how to position the microphone. Some will put
    it 90+ cm away, where accuracy will be poor. The best accuracy is when the microphone is
    about 15 cm away.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users have a tendency to lean into the microphone when they speak.
    This is unnecessary. When users lean it adds extra effort to use speech recognition. Make
    sure users know not to lean in.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Some users will lean in, and speak to the microphone with their mouth
    about 3 cm away from the element. This produces poor accuracy.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Consumes desk space.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Not good in a noisy environment.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Handheld</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Second only to close-talk and ear-piece microphones in accuracy
    because the element is close to the mouth.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Some hand-held microphones are near-field element so they're noise
    resistant.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users have seen plenty of performers using these microphones and
    already know how to use them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Some handheld microphones have switches that allow the user to turn
    speech recognition on/off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Easy to pick up and put down.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User can lean back in his/her chair and talk. (Make sure the
    microphone cord is long enough so users can lean back, even if their PC is under their
    desk.)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users feel like a rock-star.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users have to hold the microphone, which can get tiring if it's used
    for long periods of time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Microphone tends to roll when put down.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Built into computer/monitor</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Nothing to plug in.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User's hands are free.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The user doesn't necessarily know where the microphone is so they
    don't lean into it.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Low accuracy unless the user is unusually close to the monitor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Not good in a noisy environment.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Rest on top of monitor</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">User's hands are free.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The user doesn't necessarily know where the microphone is so they
    don't lean into it.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Low accuracy unless the user is unusually close to the monitor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Not good in a noisy environment.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Keyboard</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">User's hands are free.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Very low accuracy because of the typical position of the keyboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users might lean into the microphone to talk to it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Microphone picks up keyboard clicks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Not good in a noisy environment.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">In remote control</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Necessarily wireless.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">If the remote is used to control an entertainment PC from the user's
    couch, it's a good place to embed the microphone.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Remote can have a push-to-talk feature.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Moderate accuracy if the user keeps the microphone about 30 cm from
    his/her mouth.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users have to hold the microphone, which can get tiring if it's used
    for long periods of time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users don't know where to position the remote for best accuracy, so
    they may lean into it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Batteries.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Additional Features</font></h2>

<h3><font face="Arial">On/off switch, push-to-talk</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Microphones can have an on/off switch built in that starts/stops
recognition. Alternatively, the microphone can remain off except when the user presses a
button down, talks, and lets go to stop talking.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">If the user has his/her hands already on the microphone, a button
    provides a quick way to turn speech recognition on/off quickly and easily. Otherwise the
    user has to hit a key on the keyboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Having a switch on the microphone is intuitive.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Cost.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">USB</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Most microphones plug into the PC with a 1/8&quot; stereo mini-jack.
The A-to-D conversion is done internal to the PC. Alternatively, microphones can plug into
the USB port on newer machines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users can't plug the microphone into the wrong place. Users sometimes
    plug mini-jack microphone plugs into their speakers jack. The Microphone Setup Wizard
    alleviates this problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Because the A-to-D is separated from the D-to-A, the PC can record
    and play audio at the same time, even at different sampling rates.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Slightly better accuracy because the A-to-D is no longer in the
    electrically noisy chassis of the PC.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">USB microphones can have an on/off switch or push-to-talk that turns
    speech recognition on/off. The on/off switch on analog microphones can only mute the audio
    going to the speech recognizer, but the recognizer still has to process audio.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Expensive.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Not all PCs have USB.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Wireless</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Any kind of microphone can be made wireless. Wireless microphone
have the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Benefits:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">No cords attached.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Problems:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Slightly lower accuracy because of the RF transmission.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Batteries.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The user's &quot;conversation&quot; with his computer is being
    broadcast, and is no longer private.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Problems with several wireless devices are used in the same area.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Expensive.</font></li>
</ul>
