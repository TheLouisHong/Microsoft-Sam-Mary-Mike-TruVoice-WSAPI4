<h1><font face="Arial">Text-to-Speech Load Tester</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">TTSLoad.exe is a load-tester application for text-to-speech engines.
Its purpose is to help you determine how much CPU/memory an engine consumes under a
specific configuration. You can use this to:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Determine the working set and CPU for an engine.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">See how many channels of speech recognition or text-to-speech will
    run simultaneously on a telephony server.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Determine how much RAM a telephony server will need to support N
    channels of speech recognition or text-to-speech.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Find the speech engine with the best processor/performance
    trade-offs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Find the speech engine with the best memory/performance trade-offs.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">To use the load tester:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Click Run It!</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Read the instructions and press Next.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Select the speech engine you wish to test.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Press Next.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Create several text files (ANSI .txt) that you'd like the
    text-to-speech engine to speak, and copy these into a directory. The text files should
    contain text similar to what your application will speak, and with similar durations.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Type in the full path to the directory containing the text files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Type in the number of threads/instances you wish to test. If you
    application only uses one instance of an engine at a time then you can leave the value as
    1. However, if your engine uses several instances, then set the number higher, such as 4
    or 8.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Press Next.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The load test will run.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">It may take a couple of minutes for the test to load in all the
    engines and stabilize its CPU usage. You can use Performance Monitor (accessible from the
    &quot;Administrative Tools&quot; off the &quot;Start&quot; menu) or the Task Manager
    (right-click the task bar and selection it from the context menu), to determine the CPU
    usage. The process to look at is &quot;TTSLOAD.EXE&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">To determine the working set, press the &quot;Working Set&quot;
    button on the Load Tester. This flushes the engine's code and data from memory, which is
    then reloaded by the operating system as it's used. After pressing &quot;Working
    Set&quot;, wait about a minute for the in-use code/data to reload. Then, look at the
    &quot;Mem Usage&quot; field in the Task Manager's &quot;Process&quot; pane, or at
    &quot;Process/Working Set&quot; in the Performance Manager's &quot;Add to Chart&quot; menu
    option.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">You can also leave the load test running for several days/weeks, as
    an additional form of stress testing it and looking for leaks.</font></li>
</ul>
