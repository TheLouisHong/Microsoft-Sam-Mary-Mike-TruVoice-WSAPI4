<h1><font face="Arial">Getting Started!</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">Welcome to the Microsoft Speech SDK! This
page will tell you what you need for the Microsoft Speech SDK and
sample applications to work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Microsoft Speech SDK works with Windows
95/98 and Windows NT 4.0 (or better) (x86, Alpha).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you haven't already, you should </font><a
href="checkmic.htm"><font face="Arial">check your microphone and
record levels</font></a><font face="Arial"> to make sure that
speech recognition will actually hear what you're saying.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you plan to do telephony application development,
you should </font><a
href="tapi.htm"><font face="Arial">read this</font></a><font face="Arial"> to make sure that
your telephony card drivers are properly installed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You need to make sure that you have a
speech recognition and text-to-speech &quot;engine&quot;
installed on your computer. The Microsoft Speech SDK may not have
come with any engines so you may need to install them now. To use
all of the samples in the SDK you'll need three different types
of engines:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Command-and-control speech
        recognition</strong> - This allows users to give simple
        commands to their computer.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Dictation speech recognition</strong>
        - Can be used to transcribe what the user is speaking.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Text-to-speech</strong> -
        Reads out text. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">If you installed the Microsoft Speech Suite
or from the Microsoft Developers Network Level II, you should
already have some engines installed. However, if you don't, you
can contact an ISV that produces speech recognition or
text-to-speech engines. Click on &quot;<strong>Internet</strong>&quot;
to get to the engine vendors web pages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Once you have an engine, try playing
around.</font></p>
