<h1><font face="Arial">Build Environment</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">To build speech-aware applications, you must have:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 or later.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Windows 95/98 or Windows NT 4.0 (or later)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Put <strong>$(SPEECHDK)\Include</strong> in your path. $(SPEECHDK) is
    usually c:\program files\Microsoft Speech SDK. Don't forget to put the directory into
    Directories tab in Tools/Options in the Microsoft Development Studio.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">To build the samples put <strong>$(SPEECHDK)\samples\include</strong>
    in your path. Don't forget to put the directory into Directories tab in Tools/Options in
    the Microsoft Development Studio.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Put <strong>$(SPEECHDK)\Lib</strong> in your library path.
    $(SPEECHDK) is usually c:\program files\Microsoft Speech SDK. Don't forget to put the
    directory into Directories tab in Tools/Options in the Microsoft Development Studio.</font><p><font
    face="Arial">If you build a debug version of a sample that links to SpchWrap.lib, the
    linker may produce a warning: &quot;<em>LINK : warning LNK4098: defaultlib
    &quot;MSVCRTD&quot; conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library</em>&quot;.
    You can ignore this warning, if you wish, or you can build a debug version of <a
    href="spchwrap.htm">SpchWrap.lib</a> and copy it into your library directory.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Note: Some of the samples also require that the following 2 win32sdk
    directories be included: \mstools\include and \mstools\include\win95</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">We recommend you build from the Microsoft Development Studio.</font></li>
</ul>

<h2><font face="Arial">Building Samples Under MSVC 4.x</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">Some of the samples in the SD have Visual C++ 5.0 makefiles (and
.dsp files). If you open these under Visual C++ 4.x, the makefiles will not work right
away. To get the makefiles to work under Visual C++ 4.x:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Open the .mak file as a workspace.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Say yes to all the questions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Edit all occurrences of &quot;::&quot; to &quot;:&quot; in the .mak
    file remove of the occurrences of <strong>capitalized</strong> &quot;/FD&quot; command
    line parameters.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Now the compilation results will probably be placed in a subdirectory
    other than WinDebug or WinRel. Change your build/settings/executable option to point at
    the <em>subdir\theprogram.exe.</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">In addition, if you have any directory location errors in your
    development environment tools\options\directories tab, the dev environment probably would
    have still worked with other 4.2 compatible mak files -- but will fail now. Review <strong>all</strong>
    the directory options, &quot;executable&quot;, &quot;include&quot;, &quot;library&quot;,
    etc, review <strong>all</strong> drive and directory specifications listed therein, and
    make sure they are correct and current.</font></li>
</ul>
