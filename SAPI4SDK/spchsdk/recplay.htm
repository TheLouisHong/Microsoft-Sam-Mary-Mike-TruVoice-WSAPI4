<h1><font face="Arial">Play to Voice Commands/Dictation</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">RecPlay.exe allows you to record speech being spoken into the speech
recognizer, if the application is using Voice Commands or Voice Dictation for the
recognition. It also allows you to route the audio from a wave file into the application
using Voice Commands or Voice Dictation, rather than having the application listening to
the PC microphone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can use RecPlay.exe to collect recordings of real users using
your application. You can then use the recordings to analyze the accuracy of speech
recognition in your application.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To record a session:</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">Run an application that uses Voice Commands/Dictation. If you're just
    testing out this applet, you can try running <a href="coolcnc.htm">Microsoft Voice</a> or <a
    href="cooldict.htm">Microsoft Dictation</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Run the <a href="sr/recplay.exe">RecPlay.exe</a> application.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Make sure the &quot;Recording&quot; tab is visible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Under &quot;File to write audio to&quot;, type in a wave file, such
    as &quot;c:\out.wav&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Press &quot;Start&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Turn listening on in the application and speak. When you've recorded
    enough, turn listening off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">In the RecPlay.exe application, press &quot;Stop&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">To hear the recorded session, double click &quot;c:\out.wav&quot; in
    the Windows explorer.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial">Sometimes you may want to replay audio back into your application to
see how it behaves. To replay the audio:</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">Run an application that uses Voice Commands/Dictation. If you're just
    testing out this applet, you can try running <a href="coolcnc.htm">Microsoft Voice</a> or <a
    href="cooldict.htm">Microsoft Dictation</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Run the <a href="sr/recplay.exe">RecPlay.exe</a> application.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Make sure the &quot;Playback&quot; tab is visible.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Under &quot;File to read audio from&quot;, type in a wave file, such
    as &quot;c:\out.wav&quot;. The audio recording must be the same data format as the speech
    recognizer is using. If you used RecPlay.exe to record the audio, you shouldn't have any
    problem.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Press &quot;Start&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Turn listening on in the application and wait. The audio will be
    passed into the application, even though you won't be able hear it. The application should
    react as though a person were speaking to it. When you've played all the audio, turn
    listening off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">In the RecPlay.exe application, press &quot;Stop&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>You can:</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><a href="sr/recplay.exe"><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Run it!</strong></font></a></li>
