<h1><font face="Arial">Audio Collection Tool</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The audio collection tool allows you to easily collect audio
recordings from a number of different users.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">Producing a phrase file</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">First, you need to determine what the speakers will record. You do
this by listing out hundreds or even thousands of phrases/sentences that should be spoken.
An individual speaker might only record a subset of the phrases, so that each speaker
records a different subset.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The file format for a phrase file is the text
&#147;[Sentences]&#148; at the top of the file followed by a sequentially ordered list if
phrases.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>[Sentences]</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>1=Hello</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>2=Bye</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>3=Ford</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>4=This is a test</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>5=Check this out</tt></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">Avoid using punctuation, symbols, and numbers in the file. You can
write out numbers as words though.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">Recording speakers</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">To record the speakers, run the <a href="sr/collect.exe">Audio
Collection Tool</a>.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Filling in the administrative page</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">When you first run COLLECT.EXE, you will see an administrative page
that the operator should fill in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You need to fill in the following information:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Phrase path and filename -- Write the full path to the
    &#147;phrase.ini&#148; file. If it&#146;s in the same directory as COLLECT.EXE then you
    should type in &#147;.\phrase.ini&#148;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Users directory -- Find a disk, either on the local machine or
    server, that has about 500 megabytes free. Create a directory on it. Type this directory
    into the field. (Ex: &#147;c:\users&#148;) Every user that is recorded will have a
    sub-directory created by COLLECT.EXE. (Ex: User number 52 will have his/her recordings
    written in &#147;c:\users\u000052&#148;)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Microphone -- Type in the name of the microphone being recorded with.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Sound card -- Type in the name of the sound card being recorded with.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Language -- Type in the name of the language being recorded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Recording institution -- Type in your company&#146;s name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Sampling rate -- Type in the sampling rate: &#147;8000&#148; for
    phone data. Use &#147;11025&#148;, &#147;16000&#148;, or &#147;22050&#148; for PC
    recognition data depending upon the speech engine. If you don't know what sampling rate to
    use, type in 22050, and let the accuracy test application downsample the data for you if
    it's the wrong sampling rate.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">User Number -- Start out with user number 1. Every time you run this
    program, the user number will automatically be incremented, so you don&#146;t have to do
    any extra work.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Start at phrase number -- Start out with phrase number 1. Every time
    you run this program, the phrase number will be incremented to the last one recorded by
    the last user. This insures that all of the phrases/sentences are recorded. You will not
    have to modify this field after the first time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Number of phrases to speak -- You probably want this to be 100 since
    most people tire after speaking more than 100 phrases.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Speaking style -- Fill in the eight fields with some common dialects
    for the language. The user will be able to select from one of these.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">When you press &#147;Next&#148;, a dialog asking for user
information will start up.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You only have to fill this in once, because the information will be
stored away and used the next time that the application is run.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Have the user fill in user-information</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The end-user should fill out the &#147;User Information&#148;
dialog. The fields are:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Name</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Gender</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Age -- Users may not want to fill out their exact age, so they can
    just type in a number that&#146;s approximate.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Phone number -- Users may not want to type in their phone number. We
    would like this so we can contact them at some later point if we&#146;d like more speech
    data.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Beginning/experienced/advanced user -- This just gives us a feel for
    how comfortable they are with the computer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Speaking style -- A user can select one of the eight pre-defined
    ones, or type in something different.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Comments -- If you&#146;ve got any special comments to make.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">All of this information is saved in the user directory on disk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When the user presses, &#147;Next&#148;, he/she goes onto the
recording session.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">The recording session</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The Audio Collection Tool will first bring up a dialog of
instructions for the user. When the user presses &#147;Next&#148;, he/she will begin
recording.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The collection program will occupy the entire screen, and ask the
user to speak one of the phrases. When the user speaks a phrase, it will be played back to
him. He/she will then be asked if the computer recorded the correct phrase. If the user
presses &#147;No&#148;, he/she returns to recording the old phrase. If he presses
&#147;Yes&#148; then he/she moves onto the next phrase.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Some common problems at this point are:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">The user speaks too loudly/quietly -- The computer will re-adjust the
    recording volume control (if it can) and have the user speak the phrase over.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The background noise is too loud -- The user should move closer to
    the microphone or you should find a way of making the room quieter.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Background noise is recorded -- If you make a somewhat loud sound,
    the computer may think that it heard speech.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The computer records only half a phrase -- The user might be leaving
    too much of a gap between words.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">The user can pause/resume recording with the two radio buttons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You should have someone around for the recording of the first few
phrases just to make sure that the volunteer understands what he/she is supposed to do.
After that, you can leave. The program will inform the user when he/she is all done.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">When the user is done</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The program informs the user when he/she is all done, at which point
he/she can call you on the phone.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">How the data is written</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">All of the data is written to the directory specific in the
administration dialog. (Example: &#147;c:\users&#148;.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Each user will have a new subdirectory created based upon his/her
user number. (Example: User 26 is &#147;c:\users\u0000026&#148;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Under each user directory, you will find a &#147;user.ini&#148;
which stores all of the information about the user and the sentences that he/she spoke.
You will also find one wave file per phrase spoken, their names based upon the phrase
number. (Example: If the user spoke phrases 400 through 499, you&#146;d see
&#147;c:\users\u0000026\s000400.wav&#148; through
&#147;c:\users\u0000026\s000499.wav&#148;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The .wav files are standard format for windows and can be played by
any program.</font></p>
