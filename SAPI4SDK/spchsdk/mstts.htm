<h1><font face="Arial">Microsoft Concatenated Wave Text-to-Speech</font></h1>

<h1><font face="Arial">Simple &quot;text-to-speech&quot; engine</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The Microsoft Concatenated Text-to-speech Engine is a text-to-speech
engine that complies with the Microsoft Speech API and produces speech by concatenating
recordings of phrases or individual words. Because the engine uses recorded speech, it can
be very realistic. Because the text-to-speech uses recordings of phrases and words, it can
only speak those words that you (an ISV) recorded. While this prevents the text-to-speech
engine from reading arbitrary text, it&#146;s great for games, multimedia titles, and
telephony applications that know what they&#146;re going to speak ahead of time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We provide tools so that ISVs can record their own voices. This
provides the following functionality for ISVs:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Full control of the quality of the voice. ISVs can make trade-offs
    between the size of the speech database, CPU requirement, and quality of the voice.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">ISVs can generate their own unique voice to provide added value to
    their application.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Voices can have personality not found in synthesized text-to-speech.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Of course, this isn&#146;t that different than recording your own
.WAV files and writing the code to play them. But, concatenated text-to-speech is useful
because it:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Saves several man months of development and testing over writing your
    own code.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Provides tools to make the recording of voices easy. The tools also
    include down-sampling and compressing the audio using any code, such as TrueSpeech or GSM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Parses numbers and symbols in the text, and translates them to words.
    This makes phrases such as, &#147;Enemies are attacking from %d o&#146;clock!&#148; very
    easy to add.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Spells out words that have not been recorded.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Allows for experimentation during development. Synthesized
    text-to-speech can be substituted during product development so that sentence phrasing can
    be experimented with. When the spoken dialogue has solidified, a voice can be recorded to
    replace the synthesized text-to-speech.</font></li>
</ul>

<h1><font face="Arial">Resource Requirements</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The Microsoft Concatenated Text-to-Speech Engine:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Requires only a few hundred K of RAM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Disk storage depends upon the voice and the compression used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">CPU depends upon the decompression CPU. ADPCM requires a 386/16.
    TrueSpeech requires a 486sx/25. Other ACM decompression modules will consume different
    amounts of CPU.</font></li>
</ul>

<h1><font face="Arial">How to record a voice</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">To make a &#147;voice&#148; that the text-to-speech engine can speak
with, you must produce a list of sentences or phrases that you want recorded, and then
acquire recordings of them. We have a tool that you can use to record the phrases. Once
you have all of the phrases, you then run our voice compiling program to generate a .VCE
file that you distribute. As soon as this is copied into the $(WINDOWS)\Speech directory
you can use the voice for text-to-speech.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">Selecting a vocabulary</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">To produce a voice, you must know what words or phrases you want the
voice to be able to speak. The concatenated text-to-speech engine will not be able to
speak a word unless it has been recorded. If it is not recorded then it will spell out the
word.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The most obvious way of determining a vocabulary is to enumerate all
of the words that might need to be spoken out by the application. For most applications
this will be no more than a few thousand words. You should have all of these words
recorded for the voice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The text-to-speech engine also has a &#147;text pre-processor&#148;
that analyzes the text and converts numbers, times, and currencies to words. Hence, the
text &#147;52&#148; would produce the words, &#147;fifty two&#148;. Likewise,
&#147;$52&#148; is read as &#147;fifty two dollars&#148;. If your application might be
reading numbers or other text that the pre-processor produces then you will want these
recorded. See the Appendix for a list of words. Finally, if a word appears in text but is
not recorded, the text-to-speech engine will spell out the word, so you should have
recordings of individual letters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, if you just record individual words, a lot of text
that the engine speaks out will sound strange because the engine is just pasting
recordings of words together. You can try generating a voice with just individual words
and hear what it sounds like. If a real person speaks a phrase he/she naturally blends the
words together and puts gaps between sentences and noun/verb phrases. You should figure
out a set of common word phrases that your application will speak out, and have the phrase
recorded in addition to the individual words. Voice-mail applications do this; Many times
a voice-mail application will speak the text, &#147;The message was left at ten thirty two
p m.&#148; They will use one recording for &#147;the message was left at&#148;, and then
recordings for &#147;ten&#148;, &#147;thirty&#148;, &#147;two&#148;, and &#147;p m&#148;.
Of course, recording lots of phrases will enlarge the database. You just have to make a
trade-off between quality and size.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">Collecting Voice Data using TTSCol.exe</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">To record a voice, run TTSCol.exe. This brings up a small dialog
called Voice Collection Tool that facilitates collecting voice data. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Before a voice can be recorded, it is necessary to create or select
the desired project. Projects are nothing more than a means by which to group together
related voices. The first time the application is run, the project and voice lists are
blank and all buttons are disabled except New Project and Exit. In order to create a new
project, press the New Project button. This displays a dialog with several fields that
need to be filled in:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Project Name - Enter a unique name to identify the recording project.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Root Dir - This should point to a directory on a hard drive with
    enough space for all of the recordings. 50+ megabytes is a good amount. The application
    assumes c:\VoiceData as the default root directory.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Recording Studio - This string is merely for your records.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Microphone - This string is merely for your records. It&#146;s a good
    idea to write down the exact microphone in case you need to do more recording.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Manufacturer - Type in your company&#146;s name.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Once all of the project information has been filled in, press OK.
The application creates the appropriate directory. If the directory structure is already
present on the drive, the application queries to rename the new project. Press
&quot;No&quot; to continue without changes. The Voice Collection Tool dialog has been
reactivated and the New Voice button is now enabled.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Selecting a Voice</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">Press the New Voice button. A dialog titled New Voice appears. Type
in the name of the voice and press Next. The voice name is stored in the voice file, so it
might be appropriate to type in the name of the character that will be using this voice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A Voice Information dialog appears. The information that was entered
in the previous dialog should match what is shown in the &#147;Voice Name&#148; field.
Please fill in the &#147;Speaker Information&#148; and &#147;Voice Information&#148;
sections as appropriate:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Name, Address, Phone Number - These are provided for user information
    only. Typically, this is used to identify the person who actually made the recording.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Age - The text-to-speech voice contains information about the age (or
    supposed age) of the speaker. This will be accessible to the users.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Gender - Fill this in.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Style - Type in a string. Some applications will chose the
    text-to-speech voice based upon the style.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">GUID - You don&#146;t have to type this in. A GUID is randomly
    generated for each speaker to uniquely identify the voice.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">After filling in all of the necessary fields, press Next. The
Language dialog appears. Select a language and country from the list. If appropriate,
select or type in a string that describes the dialect of the voice, such as &#147;New
England&#148;, &#147;Texas&#148;, &#147;Bostonian&#148;, etc. Press OK to return to Voice
Collection Tool.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Reviewing selections</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">Selections made during the create project and/or create voice
dialogs can be reviewed and edited. There are four tabs, Voice, Language, Project, and
Options. Select the appropriate tab to review desired information. Press Change within the
tab body in order to edit the existing information. The Options tab contains program
settings which can be adjusted. In addition, the Options tab provides access to the phrase
file editor. </font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Editing a phrase file</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">When a new project is created, the application copies the default
phrase file into the project directory unless the phrase file (which must be named
phrase.ini) already exists. This file can be changed to include the specific words/phrases
that you want recorded by editing the phrase file after a new project has been created. If
this file is changed before any voices are added to that project, all new voices created
in that project inherit the new phrase file. It is also possible that each voice may
require its own individual phrase file. If this is the case, first create the voice and
then edit the phrase file. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To edit the phrase file, press the Edit Phrase File button from
within the Options tab. The phrase file edit dialog appears. The file name appears in the
dialog box title. To delete, select the phrase or phrases and press Delete. To replace a
phrase, select the phrase, type in the new phrase in the edit control and press Replace.
To insert a phrase, select the phrase after which the new phrase is to appear, type in the
new phrase in the edit control and press Add.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">After having made desired changes, press OK to save the new
phrase.ini and return to the Voice Collection Tool dialog. If you wish the application to
ignore the changes press Cancel instead.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">The recording session</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The software is designed so that the recording takes place right on
the PC. The PC must be equipped with a good quality sound card and microphone connected to
the PC for good recordings. If this quality is not good enough for your needs then you can
have the recordings transferred from a DAT, down-sampled, and saved to disk using another
application. See &#147;Hand modifying words/phrase recordings.&#148; Given that the audio
will be compressed, most high quality sound cards deliver the necessary quality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">After a speaker has been selected, the recordings can be made. To
start recording, press the Record button. If no recordings have previously been made for
the particular voice selected, the application displays a training dialog from which the
application records the speaker reading a short paragraph. From this recording the
application determines the speaking speed and base-line pitch of the voice. If some
recordings have already been made for the particular voice, the application displays the
collection dialog.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">The training dialog</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">When in the training dialog, the application displays a sentence and
asks the subject to speak it. Press Record to start recording. The subject reads the
paragraph into the microphone. When the subject is done reading the paragraph, press Stop.
The application plays back the recording. If the recording is unacceptable, press Record
and repeat the above. When satisfied with the recording, press Close. The system will then
spend some time analyzing the speech. The training dialog is replaced by the collection
dialog.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">The collection dialog</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">When in the collection dialog, the application displays the phrase
and asks the subject to speak it. Prior to listening for speaker utterances, the
application plays a tone which can help the speaker to maintain a constant pitch. (Over
the course of a particular recording session the subject&#146;s pitch tends to wander
off). The tone can be played manually by pressing Play Tone. The automatic play can be
disabled by clicking the Auto Tone checkbox. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">After playing the tone (if enabled) the application, which has a
sound detection algorithm built in, waits until the speaker says the phrase. The
application then isolates the sound from the surrounding silence and does some
calculations to determine if the sound is too quiet or too loud, if there's too much
noise, and/or if the pitch is off. If the application doesn't accept the recording, it
notifies the subject and asks the speaker to re-record the phrase. Level and pitch
rejection can be disabled by selecting the appropriate check box.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If the application determines the recording is acceptable, it plays
it back over the speakers. The application brings up a dialog box verifying that the
recording was an acceptable one. Pressing YES instructs the application to continue with
the next phrase. Pressing NO instructs the application to repeat the current phrase.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When collecting phrase recordings, the application starts with the
first phrase and works its way up. If a phrase has already been recorded, then it is
skipped. Once a phrase has been accepted it can only be re-recorded by pressing
&quot;Quit&quot; to return to the Voice Collection Tool dialog and deleting the phrase as
per the instructions in the following section.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The subject can pause recording at any time by pressing the Paused
radio button. Press Listening to resume. The subject can terminate the recording session
at any time by pressing &quot;Quit.&quot; A subsequent recording session will pick up
where left off in the previous session. Once all recordings have been made, the
application automatically closes the collection dialog and returns to the Voice Collection
Tool dialog. </font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Re-recording words/phrases</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">Recordings made during the collection session can be reviewed in the
main dialog (Voice Collection Tool). The number of phrases which have recordings are shown
in the &#147;Status&#148; window. The phrases from the currently active phrase file are
displayed in the &#147;Phrases&#148; window. To review a particular phrase, select the
desired phrase in the &#147;Phrase&#148; window. If a recording has been made of the
selected phrase, the application plays the recording. It also displays information about
the recording in the &#147;Statistics&#148; list box. If for some reason the recording is
not satisfactory, press Delete and the audio file associated with that phrase will be
deleted. Press Record to re-enter the collection dialog.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Hand modifying word/phrase recordings</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The audio recordings are all stored in the voice directory,
underneath the project directory. The wave files are all saved in the form
&#147;sXXXXXX.wav&#148;, where XXXXXX is the sentence number, starting at 1. If necessary
to modify the .WAV file, just open and modify it with any wave editor. Make sure to save
the file out as 16 bit, 22 kHz mono.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">Generating a Voice File (&lt;voiceName&gt;.vce)</font></h1>

<h2><font face="Arial">Determining a good sampling rate &amp; compression</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">All of the original data is recorded at 16-bit 22 kHz mono. While
this is great quality for voice, it takes up way too much space, 44 kBytes per second of
audio.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The voice builder application allows you to produce files in a
variety of different sampling rates and compression. You can chose between 22 kHz, 16 kHz,
11 kHz, and 8 kHz audio, along with any Audio Compression Manager compression module
installed on the system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Most applications will want to use 11 kHz ADPCM/GSM, or 8 kHz
TrueSpeech/GSM in order to reduce storage as much as possible. This is lower quality than
22 kHz PCM, so you should listen to the output to make sure it sounds good enough.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Running AudioPP.Exe</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">To create a voice, run AudioPP.Exe. This brings up a small dialog
called Voice Compiler. Press the Create button.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In the Select dialog box, fill out the following:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Source Path - The directory where all of the audio files are stored.
    This is typically, &#147;&lt;Root Dir&gt;\&lt;Project Name&gt;\&lt;Voice Name&gt;&#148;.
    For example, if &lt;Root Dir&gt; is &#147;c:\VoiceData&#148; and &lt;Project Name&gt; is
    &#147;Test&#148;, and &lt;Voice Name&gt; is &#147;Fred&#148;, then the directory is
    &#147;c:\VoiceData\Test\Fred&#148;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Destination Path - The directory where the .vce file will be written.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Output File - Name of the .vce file. If this is left as &#147;*&#148;
    then the file name will be the same as the speaker&#146;s name.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Once all the information has been entered correctly, press Next. In
the next pane, select the audio output format by selecting the desired sampling rate and
compression type. The compiler has an algorithm to further trim silent regions from the
edit of the audio. This is turned on by checking the Enable trim silence button.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">After the desired selections have been made, press Next again and
the application begins compiling the voice. This could take several minutes depending on
the type of output format and the number of phrases being compiled. When the application
has completed building the voice, the voice output file is written into the output
directory.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">Testing your voice</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">To test your new voice, copy the .vce file that you created into the
$(WINDOWS)\speech directory. You should already have the Microsoft Text-to-Speech engine
installed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Run a text-to-speech application that lets you choose a voice, like
&#147;Text-to-Speech Test&#148; (TTSTEST.EXE). Click on Add Mode and select the voice you
just created. You can now type in text and hear it spoken in your custom voice.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Phrase Disambiguation</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The text-to-speech engine will choose the longest (number of words)
possible recording at the current point in the text. Thus, if the voice has a recording of
&quot;this&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;test&quot;, &quot;this is&quot;,
and &quot;is a test&quot;, the sentence &quot;this is a test&quot; will be broken up into
&quot;(this is) (a) (test)&quot;.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Sample Voice</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">A pre-compiled sample voice is included with the SDK. To use it,
copy it from c:\program files\Microsoft speech sdk\tts\jean.vce to
$(WINDOWS)\speech\jean.vce. Start up Microsoft Mouth, or any other text-to-speech
application, and you will see &quot;Jean&quot; as one of the voices. It can speak letters,
numbers, and a few city names.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">Using your voice from a CD-ROM</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">(New for 3.0)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If your voice is too large to be copied onto the user's hard drive,
you can tell the TTS engine to access it from the CD-ROM. To do this:</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">Write a string value into
    &quot;HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSTTS\ConcatVoices&quot;. The value name should be something
    unique, and the value should be the full path to the voice.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Create the enumerator.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Erase the string value so that subsequent enumerations of the TTS
    engine won't display the voice.</font></li>
</ol>

<h2><font face="Arial">Producing a phrase file (phrase.ini)</font></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Once you know what words/phrases you want recorded, you need to
  generate a text file containing them. You must name the file &#147;phrase.ini&#148;. The
  format of the file is:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>[Sentences]</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>1=&lt;Phrase1&gt;</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>2=&lt;Phrase2&gt;</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>...</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>&lt;###&gt;=&lt;Phrase###&gt;</tt></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">For each phrase, give it a new sequential number and type in the
text. The numbers must be sequential, starting at 1, and cannot have gaps between numbers.
The phrase text can contain only letters, apostrophes, and hyphens. It cannot contain
numbers or symbols. If there is more then one word then only keep a single space between
words.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A typical file might look like:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>[Sentences]</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>1=ten</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>2=twenty</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>3=thirty</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>4=fourty</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>5=fifty</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>6=sixty</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>7=seventy</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>8=eighty</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>9=ninety</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>10=the time is</tt></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><tt>11=the date is</tt></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">The only limit to the number of phrases is the amount of space you
want a &#147;voice&#148; file to take.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A sample phrase.ini ships with the speech SDK.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Sample speaker.ini file</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">This file contains voice information. One of these must be found in
each directory which is to be compiled into a voice file. Here&#146;s a sample of what one
looks like:</font></p>
