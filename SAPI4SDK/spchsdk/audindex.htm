<h1>Audio Indexer</h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The Audio Indexer sample uses continuous dictation to index speech
audio recordings. It allows users to do keyword searches on the index, and easily jump to
the place in the recording where the keywords were used. Of course, the indexing is only
as accurate as the speech recognizer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The source code demonstrates how to use ISRResGraphEx, the file
audio source object, and controlling an engine's thread priority.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To run the demo:</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">You should pre-record the sample you wish to index. Make sure to
    leave a few seconds of silence at the end of the recording so the recognizer will index
    the last phrase. The recording should be 16-bit mono, and depending upon the recognizer,
    either 16 kHz or 22 kHz sampling rate. Telephone recordings use 8 kHz. If you record with
    the wrong sampling rate, you can up/down-sample with the <a href="wedit.htm">wave editor</a>.</font></li>
  <li><a href="sr/audindex.exe"><font face="Arial">Run it</font></a></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Press &quot;Open Wave&quot; and, using the file-open dialog box,
    select the wave file you wish to use.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">If you haven't indexed the file before, you will be asked to index it
    now. Press &quot;Yes.&quot; (If you're not asked, press the &quot;Index Wave&quot;
    button.)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">In the &quot;Select Speech Recognition&quot; dialog box:</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Select the speech recognition engine to use.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">If the audio was recorded by a speaker who has trained on your
    system, then type his/her name into the speaker field. This will make indexing more
    accurate.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Select the processing time, indicating how rapidly the audio will be
    passed to the recognizer. A rate of 1/4 means that 1 hour of audio will take 4 hours to
    process, but will consume 1/4 the CPU bandwidth normally used by the recognizer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Select the recognizer's accuracy level to use. This affects how much
    CPU is used, but not how long it takes to process. You usually want maximum accuracy,
    which takes the most CPU.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Press OK.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The recognizer will be started and will process the audio data. The
    &quot;Progress&quot; field shows you how far the indexing has gotten. When indexing is
    finished, the dialog will automatically close and return you to the &quot;Audio
    Indexer&quot; window.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">In the &quot;Audio Indexer&quot; window, to play the recording, press
    &quot;Play&quot;. The currently indexed word will be displayed as the audio plays.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">To find a word, type it into the &quot;Search for&quot; field. Only
    type one word in. Press &quot;Find next&quot; or &quot;Find previous&quot; to find the
    next/previous occurrence of the word.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">By default, the search not only looks through the recognizer's top
    recognition result for the word, but also through alternative guesses, just in case the
    top recognition result was wrong. You can disable this by un-checking the &quot;Search
    using alternatives also&quot; check-box.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">That's it.</font></li>
</ol>
