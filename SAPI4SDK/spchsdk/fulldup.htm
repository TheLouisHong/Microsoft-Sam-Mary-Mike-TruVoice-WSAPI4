<h1>Full Duplex Demo</h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The Full Duplex Demo tests to see if your sound card supports full
duplex, and if it does, allows you to interrupt its speech.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To run the demo:</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">You should either wear a close-talk headset and use speakers, or use
    headphones. Otherwise, when the text-to-speech engine speaks, the recognizer will hear the
    text-to-speech, and react to it. If your sound card supports &quot;echo cancellation&quot;
    you don't have to take this precaution, but very few, if any, sound cards support echo
    cancellation.</font></li>
  <li><a href="misc/fulldup.exe"><font face="Arial">Run it</font></a></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">In the engine selection dialog, select the speech recognition and
    text-to-speech engines that you wish to use, along with the sound cards.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Press OK to proceed. If there is any problem getting full duplex to
    work, a message box will be brought up. For full duplex to work (on most sound cards), the
    recognizer and text-to-speech engine must use the same sampling rate. The combination of
    some speech recognizers and text-to-speech engines may not work because they require
    different sampling rates.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Another dialog, &quot;Full duplex demo&quot; will appear. Speak a
    number, such as &quot;fifty two million&quot;. Text-to-speech will read back the number.
    While the computer is speaking, speak another number. The computer will stop reading the
    previous number and read back what you just spoke.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">That's it.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial">You can best take advantage of the demo by stepping through the code
and seeing how the full duplex detection is done, and by using the code in your own
application.</font></p>
