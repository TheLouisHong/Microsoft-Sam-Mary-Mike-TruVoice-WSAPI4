<h1><font face="Arial">Designing Web Pages to be Speech Enabled</font></h1>

<h2><font face="Arial">Speech Enabled Web Browses</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">Every web browser has companion applications that &quot;speech
enable&quot; it, allowing users to speak the name of a link and have the browser jump to
that link as though it were clicked. The speech functionality will be automatic, requiring
no special effort from the web-page designer for recognition to work satisfactorily.
However, although speech recognition will work automatically, a web designer can use a
little bit of care and get speech recognition to work even better.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To understand what a web designer should do to make his/her pages
work well with speech, it's necessary to describe what speech recognition needs to work,
and how the web browses automatically speech-enable a page.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">For speech recognition to work, it must know what phrases a user can
speak, such as &quot;Go to Microsoft's Web Page&quot; or &quot;Tell me about macaws&quot;.
A speech recognizer can listen for several hundred phrases at a time, and new phrases can
be loaded and unloaded at any time. For a the computer to recognize a user's speech, the
user must speak the full phrase exactly as it is written, without having words inserted or
deleted. If the user says a phrase not on the list, the recognizer returns an
&quot;unrecognized&quot; and the user has to rephrase his/her command. If the user said
&quot;Go to Microsoft's Page&quot; then the phrase, &quot;Go to Microsoft's Web Page&quot;
wouldn't be properly recognized.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Speech enabled web browsers tell the speech recognizer to listen for
all the links on a page. They use the same string as is displayed to the user. If the user
speaks the full name then the recognizer will hear it, and the browser will jump to that
link.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Fine-tuning a web page for speech</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">Here's a simple rule to fine-tune a web-page to work with
speech-enabled browser:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><strong>All of the link names must be
&quot;speakable&quot;.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A link named &quot;http://www.Microsoft.com&quot; is not very
speakable because it has to be spoken as &quot;h tee tee pee double-you double-you
double-you dot Microsoft dot com&quot;. Try saying that. Also, the user doesn't know if
they should speak the &quot;h tee tee pee&quot; part. If the link were simply &quot;Go to
Microsoft&quot;, the user could just speak that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now that you know the general principle, here are some tips and
tricks:</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Don't have more than 100 speakable items</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Speech recognition accuracy and speed will deteriorate if there are
more than a hundred (approximately) speakable items on a web page.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Don't give speakable items the same name</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">If two or more links have the same name then the computer won't be
able to tell which link the user meant.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Don't give speakable items similar sounding names</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Speech recognition has a hard time hearing the differences between
similar sounding phrases. Example, speech recognition will confuse &quot;Send mail to
Kim&quot; and &quot;Send mail to Jim&quot; easily. The more different the phrases sound,
the better the accuracy will be.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Make speakable items two to four words long</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">If a speakable item is just one word long then it's likely to sound
similar to another item. If it's two or more words long then the phrases will sound
different, and recognition accuracy will be higher. However, if a phrase is too long,
people won't want to speak it.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Don't break a link into multiple lines</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Some web pages will break a link into several lines, like this:</font></p>

<p><a href="webdsgn.htm"><font face="Arial">My favorite link</font></a></p>

<p><a href="webdsgn.htm"><font face="Arial">to my favorite</font></a></p>

<p><a href="webdsgn.htm"><font face="Arial">spot</font></a></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Or, the page will do &quot;cool&quot; capitalization like this:</font></p>

<p><a href="webdsgn.htm"><font size="6" face="Arial">M</font><font face="Arial">y </font><font
size="6" face="Arial">F</font><font face="Arial">avorite </font><font size="6"
face="Arial">L</font><font face="Arial">ink</font></a></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Neither of these produce very speakable results. In the first case
the user has to say &quot;My favorite link&quot;, &quot;to my favorite&quot;, or
&quot;spot&quot;. In the second case, the user would have to speak &quot;M&quot;,
&quot;y&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;avorite&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, or &quot;ink&quot; to
get a recognition.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Don't put ambiguous symbols and numbers in links</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">A link named &quot;6/23&quot; presents a problem because users are
unsure if they need to speak, &quot;six slash twenty three&quot;, &quot;six twenty
three&quot;, &quot;six twenty thirds&quot;, or &quot;June twenty third&quot;.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Graphics should be speakable</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">In the case of graphics, you can tell what the browser expects to
hear by:</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">Run Internet Explorer 3.0 (or higher)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Find the graphic or link in question.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Move the cursor over it and let it sit.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Within a few seconds, a tool-tip will pop up displaying the text.
    This is what the user needs to speak.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial">Users will speak the text in the graphic. If the text in the
tool-tip doesn't match the computer isn't going to understand the user.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Make the title speakable</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">All web pages have a title that is used for the
&quot;favorites&quot; list by browser applications. The Microsoft Voice application allows
user to say &quot;Go to &lt;link&gt;&quot;, where &lt;link&gt; is any of the names on the
favorites list. If the page has a lengthy title or one with ambiguous symbols, then the
user will have a difficult time speaking it.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial">ActiveX Control Design</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">ActiveX controls should comply with the ActiveX Accessibility
standard. Any ActiveX control that supports this will automatically have speakable items.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Using the Speech APIs through Visual Basic or Java</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">If you want even more speech recognition (or text to speech) than
the browser will automatically provide, then you can use ActiveX in Visual-Basic Script or
Java Script. For more information on the&nbsp; ActiveX control of speech recognition or
text-to-speech, see the Microsoft Speech API documentation.&nbsp;</font></p>
