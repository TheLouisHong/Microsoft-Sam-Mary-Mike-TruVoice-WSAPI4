<h1><font face="Arial">Redistribution Information</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">This document identifies the files that you
may redistribute with your application developed using the Speech
SDK. The conditions under which you may or may not redistribute
these files are described in the separate License Agreement
included in the Speech SDK 4.0 product. Your application's setup
only needs to install the files if your application's setup also
installs a speech recognition or text-to-speech engine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">All of the Speech SDK redistributable files
are located in the \REDIST directory of the Speech SDK 4.0
installation. When you redistribute any of these files, you
should copy them from the \REDIST directory of your Speech SDK
installation to your own distribution disk image.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">Speech API Redistribution</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The Microsoft Speech API 4.0 is
redistributable. To do so:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Arial">Have your setup program install <strong>SpchAPI.exe</strong>
        into a temporary directory.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Run <strong>SpchAPI.exe</strong>. It
        is a self-extracting executable that will install all the
        necessary files and registry entries.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Delete the temporary copy of <strong>SpchAPI.exe</strong>
        after it has been installed.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Your setup program does not need to
        uninstall the Microsoft Speech API components since it is
        a system component. Users wishing to uninstall the
        Microsoft Speech API can do so through the Control Panel,
        Add/Remove Programs.</font></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="license.txt"><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Read
        the License Agreement</strong></font></a></li>
    <li><a href="redist\api"><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Redistributable
        SpchAPI.exe</strong></font></a></li>
</ul>

<h2><font face="Arial">SpchAPI.exe command-line arguements</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">SpchAPI.exe allows for an administrator to
bypass the package prompts. This will allow for distribution of
packages to not require user input from the client. This does not
just mean hiding the UI, but also allowing for some basic control
of extract processes on a client by the admin.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">/Q Bypasses all prompts, error messages,
and file extraction animation</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">With this mode administrators would be able
to automate basic process and avoid user choices for most cases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">/Q:A Assumes user is Admin. Bypasses all
prompts, error messages, and file extraction animation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">With this mode administrators would be able
to automate basic process and avoid user choices for most cases.
Does no checking for admin rights, disk space, ect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">/Q:U (Default)Assumes user is an end user
but bypasses extraction animations. Still checks for disk space
and admin rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">With this mode users would be able to run
in a semi-Quiet mode. Used when the SpchAPI.exe package is
shipped on CDs or installed through ActiveSetup.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">/R Control or force restart</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Administrators would like ability to
actually force a restart also. This ensures the update takes
effect right way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Wextract uses: NEVER_REBOOT reboot mode
when calling InstallHInfsection to ensure that setupx.dll will
return to wextract and leave the reboot job to wextract.
Wextract.exe will decide if reboot is needed in the rules below:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Check on reg key:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">HKLM\...\Currentversion\setup</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">wextractreboot 128 or 132 .... (reboot mode
defines)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If the above key value does not exists, or
it is exists and is not one of the NEVER_xxx or ALWAYS_xxx mode,
wextract.exe checks if:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Reboot =1 in the install INF file, or if
\windows\wininit.ini is not empty</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If reboot is needed, it provides prompt or
silent reboot handling based on the result from above.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Administrators can control the restart
logic with the following entries:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">R = /R:A (Default)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">/R:= /R:A (Default)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">/R:N -- Never reboot, overrides INF
settings in package</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">/R:A -- Always reboot, prompt user with
reboot choice</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">/R:I -- Reboot if needed, prompt user with
reboot choice</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">/R:AS -- Always reboot , silent and don't
prompt user</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">/R:IS -- Silent reboot if needed, silent
and don't prompt user</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">/T:&quot;temp dir full path&quot; Provides
a path to point decompressed files to other than TEMP</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">With this switch administrators can work
around any problems with TEMP dir issues. This mainly has been
requested though so that CabPack could be used to expand files
and just drop them in a directory. If author could leave the
execution line blank this could be used to expand files in
friendly manner to a specific folder. Not delete after Wextract
is done. /T without colon is invalid and will return user to /?
command help.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If the dir specified does not exist,
wextract will create it and remove it after using the files, if
user does not also specify to leave extracted files on the
system( /C: ).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Example: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">SPCHAPI.EXE /T:&quot;MSFILES&quot;, would
expand files to MSFILES run command embedded in CabPack and clean
up files in MSFILES folder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">SPCHAPI.EXE /T:&quot;MSFILES&quot; /C:,
would exapnd files to MSFILES but run no command and not clean up
files from MSFILES folder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">By default without the /T: switch, wextract
will extract files to a unique (random created) subdir under the
Temp dir or the current dir if temp dir does not has enough
space.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial">Microsoft Concatenated Text-to-Speech
Engine</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The Microsoft Concatenated Text-to-Speech
engine plays sequential recordings of words or phrases through
the Microsoft Speech API. It is useful for applications that want
to use text-to-speech where the vocabulary is small and known at
design time. For more information see the </font><a
href="mstts.htm"><font face="Arial">Microsoft Concatenated
Text-to-speech Engine</font></a><font face="Arial">.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Microsoft Concatenated Text-to-Speech
engine files are:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">MSTTS.dll - Text-to-speech engine.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">*.vce - Text-to-speech voice files
        that you create.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">All of these files need to be installed to
$(WINDOWS)\Speech.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You must also write out the following
registry entries:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial"><tt>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Voice\TextToSpeech\Engine,
        MSTTS={2a46E4C0-4EDA-101B-931A-00AA0047BA4F}</tt></font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"><tt>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2a46E4C0-4EDA-101B-931A-00AA0047BA4F}=MSTTS</tt></font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"><tt>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2a46E4C0-4EDA-101B-931A-00AA0047BA4F}\InprocServer32=$(WINDOWS)\Speech\MSTTS.DLL<br>
        · HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
        \CLSID\{2a46E4C0-4EDA-101B-931A-00AA0047BA4F}\InprocServer32,
        ThreadingModel=Apartment</tt></font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Version Checking of MSTTS.DLL</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">Because other applications may redistribute
earlier or later versions of the same files as redistributed with
your application, it is important that you install newer versions
of the files on top of older versions on your user's system, but
not older versions on top of new versions. Typically, version
checking is the responsibility of your setup program. If you do
not have a setup program for your main application, then you must
accomplish the version checking manually when installing the
redistributable files on your user's system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can:</font></p>

    <li><a href="license.txt"><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Read
        the License Agreement</strong></font></a></li>
