<h1><font face="Arial">Test Cases for Speech Aware Applications</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">Adding speech recognition and text-to-speech adds a few more things
that could go wrong with an application. Here's a list of tests to try with your speech
aware application.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Setup</font></h2>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Does it install over existing speech API installs? </strong>-
    Test that an install over existing speech API installs works. An upgrade over an old
    version of the API should replace the old API components. An upgrade over a newer version
    of the API should overwrite nothing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Does it install over existing speech engine installs? </strong>-
    Test that an install over existing engine installs works. An upgrade over an old version
    of the engine should replace the old engine components. An upgrade over a newer version of
    the engine should overwrite nothing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Does it work with other speech aware applications? </strong>-
    Don't break other speech aware applications by overwriting their components or registry
    entries.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Uninstall </strong>- Make sure that uninstalling your
    software doesn't prevent other speech aware applications from working.</font></li>
</ul>

<h2><font face="Arial">Sound Cards</font></h2>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Different sound cards and driver versions</strong> - Make
    sure to test on different sound cards and driver versions. The variation in the sound
    cards' mixers and quality might cause problems with your application.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Test for sound card </strong>- Identify if the user doesn't
    have a sound card, or the user's sound card can't handle SR/TTS, and inform the user.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>More than one sound card </strong>- The user might have more
    than one sound card. Make sure they can chose the right one.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Half and full duplex sound cards </strong>- Test on
    half-duplex and full-duplex sound cards. Your application may behave differently in
    half-duplex than full-duplex.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Voice-Fax-Modem cards </strong>- Voice modem cards provide
    wave-out and wave-in devices for the phone. Make sure your application doesn't
    accidentally chose these as a primary listening and playback device.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>USB microphones and speakers </strong>- USB speakers are
    already on the market. USB microphones will appear soon. They may behave differently than
    sound cards.</font></li>
</ul>

<h2><font face="Arial">Speech Engines</font></h2>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Does your product work with different engines?</strong> -
    It's likely that users will install other products using speech recognition and
    text-to-speech. Users may select different engines to be used with your application, so
    you should test with them. Make sure that subtle functionality differences don't interfere
    with your application.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Does your application require a specific engine?</strong> -
    If your application requires a specific engine to function, make sure that it will select
    that engine, even if others are installed on the system.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Get the right type engine</strong> - Engines come in
    different categories; Speech recognition can be dictation and/or command &amp; control.
    Text-to-speech can be synthesized and/or recorded words. Make sure your application
    doesn't accidentally select the wrong type of engine. Ex: If you application uses command
    &amp; control, try installing a dictation engine and make sure the application doesn't
    select it or allow the user to select it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Get the right type language </strong>- Engines supporting
    different languages might be installed on the PC. Make sure the application chooses the
    proper language.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Phone vs. PC models </strong>- Many engines have special
    models for phone. Make sure your application doesn't accidentally use these if they're
    installed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>No engine installed </strong>- The application should fail
    gracefully if no engine is installed on the system.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Select favorite engine </strong>- The user may wish to select
    their favorite speech recognition or text-to-speech engine. Make sure this feature works.</font></li>
</ul>

<h2><font face="Arial">Usability</font></h2>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Can the user get the SR/TTS working? </strong>- Make sure the
    user can get the speech recognition and/or text-to-speech installed and working with
    minimal effort.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Can the user get their microphone working? </strong>- Do
    extensive testing to make sure the user can plug in their microphone and use the
    microphone correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Does the user understand how to talk to the PC? </strong>-
    Make sure that users can figure out how to talk to their PCs.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Miscellaneous</font></h2>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Proper machine speed </strong>- Some engines require
    Pentium-speed or better to function. Inform the user if their PC is too slow for speech
    recognition and/or text-to-speech. Some older Pentiums with faulty math coprocessors will
    have their math coprocessor disabled by Windows NT. If the speech engine relies on
    floating point, it may be too slow on these machines.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Gracefully fail if the API/engine is not working </strong>-
    Another application's install may break your install of the API and/or engine. If this
    happens, CoCreateInstance() and other calls will fail. Inform the user of the failure and
    recommend they reinstall to get speech recognition and/or text-to-speech working again.</font></li>
</ul>
