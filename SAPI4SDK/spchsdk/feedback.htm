<h1><font face="Arial">Feedback Application</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">Feedback demonstrates feedback from the
Microsoft Speech API. It recognizes six states. It detects when
the engine is off, when it is listening for a single wake-up
command, when it is listening for any command, when the computer
is processing a command, when a command was recognized, and when
a command was not recognized. Each of these states is indicated
by an icon. This
application displays an icon in the Windows tray that changes
according to the state of the speech recognition engine. The user
will always be able to see this icon. In addition to the icon,
Feedback displays a tooltip. The tooltip indicates the state the
icon represents, and displays the voice command recognized during
that state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Notes</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The reason that this sample uses a function
pointer is that if a direct call is placed in the source, the
linker will include code to initialize the Shell_NotifyIcon() API
whether or not you actually call it. This will cause a GP fault
under NT 3.5. With the pointer, no implicit linking is done, and
the function is only used if careful testing has confirmed that
it is available.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Command &amp; Control Speech
        Recognition Engine</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Application using Voice Commands -
        Feedback provides no voice commands of its own, so not
        much will happen unless an application is run that uses
        voice commands. You might try running the clock or voice
        command demo applications.</font></li>
