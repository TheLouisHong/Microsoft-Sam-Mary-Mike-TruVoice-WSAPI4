<h1><font face="Arial">Wave List Editor</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The wave list editor allows you to easily:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial">Cut the CPU time text-to-speech
            spends speaking prompts in your telephony
            application, by pre-recording common text-to-speech
            prompts.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial">Replace text-to-speech prompts in
            your telephony application with recorded speech.</font></li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">To use the Wave List Editor application,
you should take the following steps:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Arial">Modify your telephony application so
        that it uses logging. If you are using the telephony
        wrapper objects, this is fairly easy; You just change a
        setting in the &quot;logging&quot; dialog box.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Have a number of people call into your
        telephony application. The number of calls you'll need
        depends upon the size of your application. You should
        have enough calls logged that all of the major prompts
        have been spoken by text-to-speech. Each call will have a
        log.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Run the Wave List Editor Application.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Click the &quot;Analyze Logged
        Data&quot; button, and type in the directory where your
        application's logs (*.stl files) are stored. The software
        will analyze the logs and determine which phrases/prompts
        were spoken, and how often each was spoken.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Click the &quot;Edit wave list&quot;
        button to see the results of the analysis. The window
        will show all of the currently unrecorded prompts, sorted
        from the most frequent to the least frequent.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">You may not want to record some of the
        least frequent prompts because the hard drive space used
        is not worth the CPU savings, especially if the prompts
        are automatically generated and are not likely to be
        spoken again. To not record the prompts, select the
        prompt in the list, and press the &quot;Ignore&quot;
        button. This will move the prompt to the
        &quot;Ignored&quot; list. Of course, you can move prompts
        from the &quot;Ignored&quot; list back onto the record
        list later.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Determine which prompts you want a
        real person to record. This will depend upon the needs of
        your application. To record a prompt, select the prompt
        in the list, and press &quot;Record Wave&quot;. The
        &quot;Record Wave&quot; dialog will ask for a file name.
        Be sure to type in the full path and file name. Make sure
        that the same path will work from your telephony
        application. When you have typed in the file name, press
        &quot;Record.&quot; A new file will be created, and the
        wave editor will be brought up to record. Use the wave
        editor to record the prompt, and modify the recording.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Repeat the record process until you
        have recorded all the prompts you plan to. What's left
        will be those prompts that you're willing to have
        synthesized.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Close the &quot;Edit Wave List&quot;
        dialog, and press the &quot;Automatically Fill Wave
        List&quot; button. This will automatically pre-synthesize
        any &quot;Unrecorded&quot; prompts. (It will not
        synthesize prompts in the &quot;Ignored&quot; or
        &quot;Recorded&quot; list.) You must select a
        text-to-speech voice to use, and type in the directory
        where to write the wave files. File names will
        automatically be generated. Press &quot;OK&quot; to start
        processing.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">You can hear the pre-synthesized
        prompts by returning to the &quot;Edit Wave List&quot;
        dialog.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Finally, you should run &quot;Convert
        wave list&quot; from the main dialog to make sure that
        all your wave files are 8 kHz. If they're not 8 kHz, they
        won't work over the phone.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">To save your wave list, press
        &quot;Save wave list&quot; and type in the list name. The
        file is a Unicode text file that you can open with
        Notepad (under Windows NT). The file format is fairly
        easy to understand.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">For your telephony application to use
        the recordings, your application needs to load the
        wave-list text data into memory, and pass it into either
        ISTTTSLog::WaveAddFromList or ITelInfo::QuickCreate. The
        file format is compatible with the data formats used by
        WaveAddFromList or QuickCreate.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">To make development quicker, you can
        save the wave list in your telephony application's
        project directory. Modify your resources to include the
        wave-list file as type &quot;TEXT&quot;, and have your
        project load the resource, and pass it into
        WaveAddFromList or QuickCreate. If you are using the C++
        wrappers, you can use an overloaded version of
        WaveAddFromList or QuickCreate that automatically loads
        the data from a resource.</font></li>
